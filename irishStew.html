    <h1>Slow Cooker Irish Stew</h1>
    <p>
      This slow cooker Irish stew is pure comfort food for a chilly day. A
      little prep time is needed upfront. Don't be fooled by how much onion and
      garlic are used. It's honestly not too much. Cheers!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 russet potatoes, diced</li>
      <li>1 pound baby carrots</li>
      <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste</li>
      <li>2 pounds beef chuck roast, cubed</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) bottle stout beer, divided</li>
      <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 cup beef broth</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon smoked paprika</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
    <p>Place potatoes, carrots, onion, and garlic into a slow cooker.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
    <p>
      Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add beef; cook and stir
      until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer beef to the slow cooker
      with vegetables.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
    <p>
      Pour 1/4 cup beer into the same skillet and bring to a boil while scraping
      the browned bits of beef off of the bottom of the skillet with a wooden
      spoon. Stir in tomato paste; cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. Pour
      mixture into the slow cooker.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
    <p>
      Pour remaining beer, beef broth, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika,
      salt, and pepper into the slow cooker.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
    <p>
      Cook on Low until potatoes and carrots are easily pierced with a fork,
      about 8 hours, or on High for 3 to 4 hours.
